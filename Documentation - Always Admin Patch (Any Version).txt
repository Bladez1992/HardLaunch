Actually very simple

90 90 90 90 90      <---- Find these hex bytes in HardwarW.exe
85 4D 24 00 00      <---- Change them to this

This should be the only cluster of bytes like this in the whole file
That's why I didn't include offsets for each version, it's unnecessary
Doing this on any version below U3.00b1 is pointless (no TI access)
