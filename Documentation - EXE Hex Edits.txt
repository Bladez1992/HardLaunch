For the version switcher, these were replaced in HardwarW.exe and Hardman.exe as necessary
Not all versions reference all of these files, this is just a general example of how I did it

-- Example (UIM.05)--
Hardman        - HmanUM5
HardwarW.exe   - HardWUM5.exe
Hardwar.res    - HardUM5.res
Hardup.res     - HupUM5.res
Hardim.res     - HimUM5.res
